This is small testsuite for vilistextum.

Tests:
check_tags
  A generic test which ensures that vilistextum is at least minimal
  functional.

check_entities
  Checks if all named character entities are correctly translated with
  locale iso-8859-1.

check_utf8
  If vilistextum is compiled as multibyte version, this check tests
  vilistextum's UTF-8 ability.

	The html file is taken from the great "UTF-8 Sampler" page
