This is small testsuite for vilistextum.

Tests:
check_tags
  A generic test which ensures that vilistextum is at least minimal
  functional.

check_entities
  Checks if all named character entities are correctly translated with
  locale iso-8859-1.


The following tests only work when vilistextum is compiled as 
multibyte version.

check_latin2
	Checks if reading and writing of a iso-8859 charset other than
	iso-8859-1(latin1) is working.

check_utf8
  This check tests vilistextum's UTF-8 ability.

	The html file is taken from the great "UTF-8 Sampler" page
