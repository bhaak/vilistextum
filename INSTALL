iso-8859-1 / latin1 version
===========================

$ ./configure --disable-multibyte && make
# make install (as root)

The standard version of vilistextum should compile on any system with a
C-Compiler. It has been successfully compiled on Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris
systems.


Multibyte/Unicode version
=========================
Since 2.8.0 the multibyte version will be built by default

$ ./configure && make
# make install (as root)

The multibyte version needs a good iconv implementation. The best and
most portable implementation is libiconv.
http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
The glibc (GNU C Library) implementation is also sufficient. For
non-glibc systems, libiconv is recommended.

The configure script detects if libiconv is installed and falls back
to the standard iconv implementation if not.

"make test" will fail if the iconv implementation is insufficient.

Misc
====
If GNU getopt is not installed, the POSIX getopt will be used.
In this case long options are not available.
