    Linux PPP <u>without</u> X-Windows</strong></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small><u><strong>Step 1</strong></u></small><br>
    <small>You will need a program called '<strong>chat</strong>' installed on your system.
    This comes with most of the newer distributions. If you dont have it you can pick it up
    via ftp at <a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu">sunsite.unc.edu</a>.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>You will also need to have ppp support compiled in your
    kernel. To see if you have this type 'ppp' as root. If you get a message that says
    something like 'This kernel does not support ppp' or something similar then you will need
    to recompile your kernel and include ppp support. You can get the kernel source via ftp at
    <a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel">sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel</a> </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small><u><strong>Step 2</strong></u></small><br>
    <small>Become root. Now create a directory called /etc/ppp if its not already there. You
    will need to create 3 files in this directory. These files are called options, abraxis,
    and ppp. <br>
    <br>
    file contents<br>
    -------------<br>
    <br>
    options:<br>
    </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>/dev/modem<br>
    38400<br>
    crtscts<br>
    noipdefault<br>
    defaultroute</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>*note: the /dev/modem is the link to your modem.. you can
    specify exactly which port to use by changing that to /dev/cua1 or whatever port your
    modem is on. <br>
    <br>
    abraxis: </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;&quot;atdt7708139299 CONNECT &quot;&quot; gin:
    username&nbsp; word: password</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>*note: this looks for the string 'gin' (from the login:
    prompt) and then sends 'username' then it looks for 'word' (from the password: prompt) and
    sends 'password'. <br>
    <br>
    ppp: </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>#!/bin/bash<br>
    /usr/sbin/pppd 115200 asyncmap 0 connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/abraxis'</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>*note: this is the shell script so chmod it executable <br>
    <br>
    <u><strong>Step 3</strong></u></small><br>
    <small>Create a file called /etc/resolv.conf <br>
    resolv.conf:<br>
    </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>domain abraxis.com<br>
    nameserver 204.70.57.242<br>
    #nameserver 206.115.199.201</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Step 4</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Now chmod the file /etc/ppp/abraxis only readable and
    writeable to root so that nobody can read your password. <br>
    <br>
    Plug your modem and type /etc/ppp/ppp and you hear your modem chug away and you should be
    automatically logged in to the net. </small></font></p>

    Linux PPP <u>with</u> X-Windows</strong></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><u><strong><small>Getting Started</small></strong></u><br>
    <small>First of all, make sure you have all the info necessary for a normal connection to
    Abraxis, such as-- at least one DNS nameserver address, the dialup numbers to Abraxis, and
    of course your login information. I personally use the the Redhat 4.2 distribution of
    Linux so I will explain everything in terms of that, but it should all be pretty much very
    similar. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><u><b><small>PPP Setup</small></b></u><br>
    <small>Ok. Now of course you MUST log into your system as root, so as to start the PPP
    service.&nbsp; Or, you can set the file mode on the PPP daemon (PPPD) as SUID root, ie:
    chmod +s /usr/bin/pppd.&nbsp; After this change is made then any user (with the correct
    permissions) can run PPP. Anyhow, assuming you are root and logged in to your system or
    have permissions, type &quot;startx&quot; to start X-windows. Next, open up the control
    panel and click on Network Configuration. Obviously if you dont have networking installed
    on your system this wont work! Next, you should see a window pop up that says
    &quot;Network Configurator&quot; at the top. There should be 4 buttons to click on--Names,
    Hosts, Interfaces, and Routing. I will go through each one seperately and tell you what
    you must enter in each.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><u><b><small>Names</small></b></u><br>
    <small>Hostname: Enter your Abraxis login name here. ex:wolson </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Domain: Enter &quot;hostname.abraxis.com&quot;
    ex:wolson.abraxis.com </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>NameServers: Enter DNS name server addresses here
    ex:206.155.199.201 204.70.57.201 Now we go to next section... </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Hosts: if you clicked &quot;save&quot; on Names
    section,everything should be ready here, so well skip it. Onto next section... </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Interfaces: Here's where the actual process begins. click on
    &quot;add&quot; a window should pop up that says &quot;choose Interface Type&quot; , click
    on &quot;PPP&quot;, then click &quot;ok&quot;. Next another screen will pop up that says
    &quot;Create PPP Interface&quot; Here it asks for the Abraxis dial-in number, your
    username, and password. Next click on &quot;customize&quot; There's 3 sections here,
    Hardware, Communication, and Networking. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Hardware: make sure &quot;hardware flow control and modem
    lines&quot; is clicked and also &quot;abort connection on well known errors&quot; just to
    be sure. Don't click on &quot;escape control characters&quot; . Also, your line speed and
    modem port should already be setup, if not you'll have to set up your modem in the
    &quot;modem&quot; section of the control panel (email me for questions). </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Communication: You should already see this on the screen.
    Expect, Send , Login your user name &gt;ord your password &gt; &gt;</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Networking: all you should have to worry about here is
    clicking on &quot;set default route when making connections&quot; any other options are up
    to you, but this will get you going. Now on to routing, last section.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Routing: Nothing to do here! Thank God! Anyways, now you
    should have a fully functional PPP connection set up, assuming you've saved everything at
    all times. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Now to connect to Abraxis, all we have to do is, at the
    Interfaces portion of the Network Configurator Main Window, click on your ppp entry, will
    be something like, ppp0,ppp1,etc...Now click on &quot;Activate&quot; and if all goes well
    it will dial-up Abraxis and take care of the rest for you! To make sure you have a good
    connection, open up a shell window and type &quot;ifconfig&quot;. If you see
    Point-To-Point protocol you're good to go! If you don't see it the first time you type
    &quot;ifconfig&quot; keep trying it, chances are its taking a while to connect. Once you
    DO see &quot;point to point protocol&quot; you can pretty much do anything you want---
    telnet, ftp, netscape (I have 3.01 for linux), email, or whatever clients you wish.</small></font></td>
